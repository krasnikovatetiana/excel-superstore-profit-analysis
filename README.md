## Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis (Excel)

### Overview
This project analyzes sales and profitability performance across regions, product categories, and customer segments to identify key drivers of performance differences and support data-driven business decisions.

### Problem statement
Superstore experiences uneven sales and profitability across regions, product categories, and customer segments. The business needs to understand which factors drive these differences in order to improve sales performance and overall profitability.

### Why it matters
Understanding performance drivers enables the business to allocate resources more effectively, optimize pricing and discount strategies, improve regional performance, and support sustainable growth.

### Tools
- Excel (pivot tables, calculated fields, charts)

### Key insights
- Strong and consistent performance was observed in the Western region, the Technology category, and the Consumer segment.
- The South region and Furniture category showed weaker profitability, driven by higher discount levels and lower margins.
- Clear seasonal sales peaks in November and December highlighted the importance of inventory planning and promotion timing.
- Regional and customer-segment analysis revealed opportunities to scale high-performing models across other markets.

### Conclusions & recommendations
The analysis demonstrated that profitability is driven not only by sales volume, but also by regional focus, category mix, discount strategy, and seasonality.  
Recommended next steps include optimizing pricing and discount strategies in underperforming categories, replicating high-performing regional practices, strengthening loyalty and targeted marketing initiatives, and improving operational readiness ahead of peak seasons.

### Notes
The analysis was performed using a structured educational dataset for analytical practice.
